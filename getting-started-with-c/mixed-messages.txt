A short C program is listed below. One block of the program is
missing. Your challenge is to match the candidate block of code (on
the left) with the output that youâ€™d see if the block were
inserted. Not all of the lines of output will be used, and some of the
lines of output might be used more than once. Draw lines connecting
the candidate blocks of code with their matching command-line output.

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int x = 0;
    int y = 0;
    while (x < 5) {
       /*
       * Block of code here
       */
       printf("%i%i ", x, y);
       x = x + 1;
   }
   return 0;
}

Candidates:
y = x - y;            00 11 21 32 42

y = y + x;            00 11 23 36 410

y = y + 2;
if (y > 4)            02 14 25 36 47
    y = y - 1;    

x = x + 1;
y = y + x;            11 34 59

if (y < 5) {
    x = x + 1;
    if (y < 3)
        x = x - 1;    02 14 36 48
}
y = y + 2;
