Each of the C files on this page represents a complete source
file. Your job is to play compiler and determine whether each of this
files will compile, and if not, why not. For extra bonus points, say
what you think the output of each compiled file will be when run, and
whether you think the code is working as intended.

A
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int card = 1;
    if (card > 1)
        card = card - 1;
	if (card < 7)
	    puts("Small Card");
	else {
	    puts("Ace!");
    }
    return 0;
}

This program will compile!

Output:
Small Card

Discussion:
It seems the program doesn't work as intended. Value of card is set to
1 so the evaluation of first if returns false and the program goes
straight to second if.

B
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int card = 1;
    if (card > 1) {
        card = card - 1;
	if (card < 7)
	    puts("Small card");
	else
	    puts("Ace!");
    }
    return 0;
}

The program will compile but will quit without any output and is not
working as intended because else is matched with wrong if.


C
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int card = 1;
    if (card > 1) {
        card = card - 1;
	if (card > 7)
	    puts("Small card");
    } else
      puts("Ace!");
      return 0;
}

The code will compile and work as intended.
Output:
Ace!

D
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int card = 1;
    if (card > 1) {
        card = card - 1;
	if (card < 7)
	    puts ("Small card");
    else
        puts("Ace!");
    return 0;
}

This code will not compile
Output:
[Something like missing '}' ]
