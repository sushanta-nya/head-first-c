Try to guess what each of these code frangments does.

int card_count = 11;
    initialize card_count to 11

if (card_count > 10)
   if card count is greater than 10 ...

   puts("The deck is hot. Increase bet.");
   	     Output this line.

int c = 10;
    initialize c to 10

while (c > 0) {
      As long as c is greater than 0 do ...

      puts("I must not write code in class");
      	      output this line.

      c = c - 1;
      	      reduce c by 1

}
	End of while loop

/* Assume name shorter than 20 chars. */
   This is a comment.

char ex[20];
     Get a character array of length 20

puts("Enter boyfriend's name: ");
     Output this line.

scanf("%19s", ex);
     Scan 19 characters and insert it into ex

printf("Dear %s.\n\n\tYou're history.\n", ex);
     Out the line replacing %s with value of ex

char suit = 'H';
     Initialize suit to 'H'

switch(suit) {
     Start checking suit

case 'C':
     If it is 'C' do ...
     puts("Clubs");
     break;	break out of switch

case 'D':
     puts("Diamonds");
     break;

case 'H':
     puts("Hearts");
     break;

default:
	If any of the previous cases doesn't trigger do ...
	puts("Spades");
}
	End of Program.
