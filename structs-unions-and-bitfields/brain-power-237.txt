This code is doing something weird. But you've already been given
enough information to tell you exactly what happened. Can you work out
what it is?

A. C passes everything by value so in this case passed a copy of
turtle structure. The code worked for a while because it was
displaying the copied structure but failed the moment function
returned because original copy was unaltered.
