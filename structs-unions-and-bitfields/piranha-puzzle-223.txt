Your job is to write a new version of the catelog() function using the
fish struct. Take fragments of code from the pool and place them in
the blank lines below. You may not use the same fragments more than
once, and you won't need to use all the fragments.

void catalog(struct fish f)
{
    printf("%s is a %s with %i teeth. He is %i\n", f.name, f.species,
    f.teeth, f.age);
}

int main()
{
    struct fish snappy = {"Snappy", "Piranha", 69, 4};
    catalog(snappy);
    /* We're skipping calling label for now */
    return 0;
}
