The guys in the longue has already started to write the code to search
through the track list, but - oh no! - some of the paper they were
writing the code on has fallen into the pool. Do you think you can
select the correct pieces of code to complete the search function?
It's been a while since the pool was cleaned, so be warned: some of
the code in the pool might not be needed for this program.
Note: the guys have slipped in a couple of new pieces of code they
found in a book somewhere.

void find_track(char search_for[])
{
    int i;
    for (i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        if (strstr(tracks[i], search_for))
	    printf("Track %i: '%s'\n", i, tracks[i]);
	}
}
