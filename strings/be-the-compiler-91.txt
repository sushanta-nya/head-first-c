The jukebox program needs a main() function that reads input from the
user and calls the find_track() function on the opposite page. Your
job is to play like you are the compiler and say which of the
following main() functions is the one you need for the jukebox
program.

int main()
{
    char search_for[80];
    printf("Search for: ");
    fgets(search_for, 80, stdin);
    find_track(search_for);
    return 0;
}
