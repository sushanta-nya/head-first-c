The guys are working on a new piece of code for a game. They've
created a function that will display a string backward on the
screen. Unfortunately, some of the fridge magnets have moved out of
place. Do you think you can help them to reassemble the code?

void print_reverse(char *s)
{
    size_t len = strlen(s);

    char *t = s + len - 1;

    while (t >= s) {
        printf("%c", *t);

        t = t - 1;
    }
}
