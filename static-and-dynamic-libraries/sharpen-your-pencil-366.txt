1. Start by creating an object file called hfcal.o. The hfcal.h header
is going to be stored in ./includes:

A. gcc -c hfcal.c -o hfcal.o -I./includes

2. Next, you need to create an object file called elliptical.o from
the elliptical.c test program

A. gcc -c elliptical.c -o elliptical.o -I./includes

3. Now you need to create an archive library from hfcal.o and store it
in ./libs:

A. ar -rcs ./libs/libhfcal.a hfcal.o

4. Finally, create the elliptical executable using elliptical.o and
the hfcal archive:

A. gcc elliptical.o -o elliptical -lhfcal -L./libs
