Why do you think sizeof(msg) is shorter than the length of the whole
string? What is msg? Why would it return different sizes on different
machines?

A.
sizeof(msg) is shorter than the length of the whole string because msg
is actually a pointer. The difference size is because pointers are of
different size in different machines.
