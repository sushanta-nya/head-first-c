We have a classic trio of bachelors ready to play The Mating Game
today.

Tonight's lucky lady is going to pick one of these fine contestants.
Who will she choose?


#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int contestants[] = {1, 2, 3};
    int *choice = contestants;
    contestants[0] = 2;
    contestants[1] = contestants[2];
    contestants[2] = *choice;
    printf("I'm going to pick contestant number %i\n",
    contestants[2]);
    return 0;
}

I'm going to pick contestant number 2.
