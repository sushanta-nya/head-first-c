There's a new program helping the waiters bus tables at the Head First
Diner. The code automatically totals a bill and adds sales tax to each
item. See if you can figure out what needs to go in each of the
blanks.

Note: there are several data types that could be used for this
program, but which would you use for the kind of figures you'd expect?

#include <stdio.h>

float total = 0.0;
short count = 0;
short tax_percent = 6;

float add_with_tax(float f);
{
    float tax_rate = 1 + tax_percent / 100.0;
    total = total + (f * tax_rate);
    count = count + 1;
    return total;
}

int main()
{
    float val;
    printf("Price of item: ");
    while (scanf("%f", &val) == 1) {
        printf("Total so far: %.2f\n", add_with_tax(val));
	printf("Price of item: ");
    }
    printf("\nFinal total: %.2f\n", total);
    printf("Number of items: %hi\n", count);
    return 0;
}
