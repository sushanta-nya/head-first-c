Look at the program below. Part of the program is missing. Your job is
to play like you're the compiler and say what you would do if each of
the candidate code fragments on the right were slotted into the
missing space.

#include <stdio.h>

/* missing space */
    printf("A day on Mercury is %f hours\n", day);
    return 0;
 }

float mercury_day_in_earth_days()
{
    return 58.65;
}

int hours_in_an_earth_day()
{
    return 24;
}

Fragment #1
float mercury_day_in_earth_days();
int hours_in_an_earth_day();

int main()
{
    float length_of_day = mercury_day_in_earth_day();
    int hours = hours_in_an_earth_day();
    float day = length_of_day * hours;

[X] You can compile the code
[ ] You should display a warning
[X] The program will work

Fragment #2
float mercury_day_in_earth_days();

int main()
{
    float length_of_day = mercury_day_in_earth_day();
    int hours = hours_in_an_earth_day();
    float day = length_of_day * hours;

[X] You can compile the code
[X] You should display a warning
[X] The program will work

Fragment #3

int main()
{
    float length_of_day = mercury_day_in_earth_day();
    int hours = hours_in_an_earth_day();
    float day = length_of_day * hours;

[ ] You can compile the code
[X] You should display a warning
