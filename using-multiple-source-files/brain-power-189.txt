Think carefully. Even a simple change might mean running a large, slow
compile to see the result. Given what you know about the compilation
process, how could you speed up the time to recompile the program?

A. It seems the compiler compiles everything during compilation. That
need not to be so. The compiler can simply recompile the modified
source file and relink everything back together to generate the
executable file.
