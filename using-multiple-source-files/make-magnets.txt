Hey, baby, if you don't groove to the latest tunes, then you'll love
the program the guys in the Head First Lounge just wrote! oggswing is
a program that reads an Ogg Vorbis music file and creates a swing
version. Sweet! See if you can complete the makefile that compiles
oggswing and then uses it to convert a .ogg file:

oggswing: oggswing.c oggswing.h
	  gcc oggswing.c -o oggswing
swing.ogg: oggswing whitennerdy.ogg
	   oggswing whitennerdy.ogg swing.ogg
