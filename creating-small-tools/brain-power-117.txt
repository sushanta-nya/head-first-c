Study the code. What do you think happened? Is the code doing what you
asked it to? Why werenâ€™t there any error messages? Why did the mapping
program think that the entire output.json file was corrupt?

As we are redirecting the output to another file the error we printed
with printf also got to that file and corrupted it.
