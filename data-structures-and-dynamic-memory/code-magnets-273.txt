Oh, no, the code for the display() function was on the fridge door,
but someone's mixed up the magnets. Do you think you can reassemble
the code?

void display(island *start)
{
  island *i = start;

  for(; i != NULL; i= i->start.next) {
    printf("Name: %s open: %s-%s\n", i->name, i->opens, i->closes);
  }
